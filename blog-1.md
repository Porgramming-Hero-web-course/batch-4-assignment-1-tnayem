1. The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Union and intersection types in TypeScript are powerful features. They help us define more flexible, precise, and reusable type definitions in our applications. 

Union Types (|):
A union type allows a value to be of one of several types. It is defined using the (|) symbol.
Example:
function myValue(value: string | number) {
    console.log(value);
}
myValue("Hello World"); // Valid
myValue(10); // Valid
myValue(true); // Error

Intersection Types (&):
An intersection type combines multiple types into one, requiring a value to satisfy all types simultaneously. It is defined using the (&) symbol.

Example: 

type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { employeeId: number };

type EmployeePerson = Person & Employee;

const emp: EmployeePerson = {
    name: "Nayem",
    employeeId: 12345
};


Union types are essential for handling multiple potential types and enabling polymorphic behavior. Intersection types are invaluable for composing and enforcing strict type constraints. Both contribute to making TypeScript a versatile language for strongly-typed programming.
